We will use the world database that we loaded into MySQL workbench in the lesson titled "MySQL Workbench" For reference, the file can be found again here. [(download the file here)](https://assets.codingdojo.com/boomyeah/company_209/chapter_3569/handouts/chapter3569_5432_world.sql)

The goal of this assignment is for you to get practice with SQL queries and to get familiar with using MySQL workbench. The questions are of varying difficulty levels. Some require joins.

Write and run these queries in MySQL workbench to obtain the answers.

Take a screenshot of each query with the results and paste it into a single document. Post the document on your GitHub repository and share the link below.
